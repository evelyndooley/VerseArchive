Although Zacharias invented the microscope, it was Galileo who
introduced it to the scientific world. He published a book in 1610
in which he wrote: “About ten months ago a rumour reached me of an
ocular instrument made by a certain Dutchman, by means of which an
object could be made to appear distinct and near to an eye that looked
through it, although it was really far away. And so I considered the
desirability of investigating the method, and reflected on the means by
which I might come to the invention of a similar instrument. I first
prepared a leather tube at the ends of which one placed two lenses
each of them flat on one side, and as to the other side I fashioned
one concave and the other convex. Then holding the eye to the concave
one, I saw the objects fairly large and nearer, for they appeared three
times nearer and nine times larger than when they were observed by
the naked eye. Soon after I made another more exactly, representing
objects more than sixty times larger. At length, sparing no labour and
no expense, I got to the point that I could construct an excellent
instrument so that things seen through it appeared a thousand times
greater and more than thirty-fold nearer than if observed by the
naked eye.” Galileo had his enemies, who accused him of having picked
Zacharias’s brains; he admitted that he had taken his idea from the
Dutchman’s invention, but further than that he would not go; in fact,
he replied that the invention of Zacharias was a mere accident but that
his own instrument was discovered by a process of reasoning.
